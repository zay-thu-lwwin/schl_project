            <p1 id="t_w" >Web development typically refers to the coding and programming side of website production.When you learn web development, you might start out writing a simple page of HTML text and
                build up to creating more complex, feature-rich applications designed to be accessed from variousInternet-connected devices. Examples of feature-rich web development include e-commerce websites, 
                content management systems (CMS), and social networks. Common programming languages and software webdevelopers may use include Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), JavaScript,
                 PHP, Drupal, and MySQL.</p1>

               <h2 id="t_w" >Types of Web Development</h2>
               <p1 id="t_w" >They are different types of web development: front-end, back-end, and full-stack development.1 Note that web developers specialize in building websites, as opposed to mobile applications, video games, or software.
                </p1>
                <ul1 id="t_w" >
                  <li><strong>Front-end Development</strong>  refers to the client- or user-facing side of websites. Front-end developers design and develop the visual aspects of a website, including the layout, navigation, graphics, and other aesthetics. Their main job is to build interfaces that help users reach their goals, so front-end developers are often involved in user experience (UX).</li>
                  <li><strong>Back-end Development</strong>  focuses on everything the user doesn’t see. Back-end developers work with servers, operating systems, application programming interfaces (APIs), and databases. They manage the code for security, content, and site architecture. They collaborate with front-end developers.</li>
                  <li><strong>Full-stack Development</strong>encompasses both the front-end and back-end sides of a website or software program.2 Full-stack developers can create a website from start to finish. In addition to understanding HTML and CSS, these developers know how to program a browser, server, and database. They are skilled at working with the different technologies that handle different functionalities on a website, often requiring years of training and experience.  </li>

               <h2>Web development curriculum</h2>
               <p>Aspiring professionals in this field can learn how to build websites entirely online, 
                through online coding boot camps, web developer certifications, or web development
                courses online. From HTML tutorials to in-depth courses in responsive web design,
                individuals can learn the latest client- and server-side coding practices. Web 
                development curriculum varies by level and by the particular course and subject,
                but most intro classes will cover HTML and CSS basics along with popular web programming
                languages like Python and JavaScript. There are also web development courses geared toward
                back-end development that focus on databases, applications, and software.
                Enroll in any of these introductory classes to learn web development and start building
                websites in just a few short weeks.</p><br>

               <h2>How to become a web developer</h2>
               <p>Educational requirements vary for web developers based on the employer, your particular role, 
                and other factors. Many professionals working as web developers hold a bachelor’s degree, with
                some employers preferring to hire web developers who have specifically earned a bachelor’s degree 
                in computer or data science or programming. For professionals looking to advance to a senior role or
                specialize in certain technologies, a master’s degree in data science may make them more competitive
                in the job market. But web developers may not need specific education credentials if they can demonstrate
                their abilities through prior work experience or projects.
                For learners just starting out or professionals who want to expand their knowledge of specific skills, coding 
                boot camps, and online web development courses can help teach coding and other applicable tech skills.</p><br>
