        <p id="t_w">
             Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks,and programs from digital attacks. 
             These cyberattacks are usually aimed at accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive information; extorting money from users through ransomware; or interrupting normal business processes.
             Implementing effective cybersecurity measures is particularly challenging today because there are more devices than people, and 
             attackers are becoming more innovative.A successful cybersecurity posture has multiple layers of protection spread across the computers, networks, programs, 
             or data that one intends to keep safe. In an organization, a unified threat management gateway system can automate integrations across
             products and accelerate key security operations functions: detection, investigation,and remediation. People, processes, and technology must all complement one another to create an effective defense from cyberattacks.

    <div id="t_w"><h1>Common types of cybersecurity threats</h1><br><br>
        <p id="t_w"> Information can be compromised through a variety of tactics. Examples of common cyberthreats include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p id="t_w">
                    <b>Malware: </b>
                    Short for “malicious software,” malware variants include worms, viruses, trojans, and spyware.
                     These types of software can give cyberattackers unauthorized access to data or cause damage to a computer system. 
                </p>
            </li>


            <li>
                <p id="t_w">
                    <b>Ransomware: </b>
                            Ransomware is another type of malware that can lock down computer systems with the threat to destroy or compromise sensitive data unless a ransom is paid to the cyberattacker.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p id="t_w"><b>Phishing: </b>
                    Phishing is a tactic that attempts to trick users into providing sensitive information, such as their username and password to an account, credit card number, or personal information.
                     This type of scam sends messages from seemingly legitimate organizations asking for the information they intend to steal for their use. 
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p id="t_w"><b>Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks: </b>
                    These types of cyberattacks attempt to crash a server, network, or website by overloading it with traffic. DDoS attacks typically use multiple coordinated systems to achieve the goal of overwhelming the system.
